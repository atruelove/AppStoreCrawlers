I like IP enabled devices that can be managed outside of their creators. I would be more comfortable with Quickset if they offered an app and device that did not collect or connect online.

I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S7 on Android 6.1 and its reliability has dropped to such a low point that I now need to carry physical keys with me because it only works less than 40% of the time. Sometimes I log off and back on the app works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm having the same issue on a second phone an iPhone 6. These are both Kevo 1st generation deadbolts.  Same issue with both locks."}

The iPhone 7 works well, and my old note 4 works every single time.   It's a terribly frustrating system from a reliability standpoint."}

{"Author": "Aaron Wallace", "Date": "June 20, 2017", "Stars": " Rated 5 stars out of five stars ", "Text": "Works as I would expect. The instructions said it would not be compatible with my existing lock however it came with everything I needed even if I had no existing lock. The app started off a little finicky due to the verification process. Just remember to close the app after completing the verification process then opening it and starting your ekeying procedures. I use the same account on both my phone and my wife's phone so I did not have to generate another set of keys however this may cause me issues later, I guess I will find out. I love the fact that it does not connect to the Internet so it being hacked is less of a worry. Locks do not need access to the internet due to your phone being able to program them locally and you can email the ekey to someone if they need to get in without you being home. I have not tried this yet but hopefully will soon. The only issue I have at the moment is the possibility of your phone being too close to the lock while being home which can allow someone to walk up and unlock your door if your phone is too close. That can be solved by simply turning off your Bluetooth while at home but that is not something people will like to do. So far it works great with no issues."}

No problem with that but the app should ask during installation instead of having to change permissions in settings.  This is a must have for anyone.  I love the ekey sharing feature.

When the direction tell you to follow in app instructions. You must first push the + sign in the app to add the hub. No where and I repeat no where that I looked whether it was online or in forums did it say this. Since then we have had the hub hooked up for a week with no issues. We have been using the lock for 3 weeks. We did notice before the hub there was a little bit of a lag when locking or unlocking by Bluetooth but since it seems to be more efficient.

The app functions as intended on my Nexus 6.  Locking/unlocking works every time, no issue so far.  One feature you may consider adding to the app before it comes out of beta is to detect whether bluetooth is turned on when the app is first being set up (and to remind the user to turn on the bluetooth if it is off).  It will smooth out any issues with users who may not realize that their bt is turned off and wonder why their phone isn't communicating with the lock.  Update:  App is now also compatible with Google Pixel."}

Got the phone home, only to be advised by Google Play that the app is incompatible.   After a few days, and many hours with tech support, uninstalling, reinstalling etc. etc. it was finally resolved by them tweaking something on their end.  Current Status: Update phone to Marshmallow (6.0.1 - STOCK) a few weeks ago, and all continues to work fine.  Reset my phone to factory tonight, go to download app and the farking thing is telling me it is incompatible.  This is utter crap.  It has been working just fine under Marshmallow for weeks.  Now I have an expensive lock I cannot lock/unlock VIA the phone.  This is clearly the ONLY reason to purchase said lock.   Y'all need to allow the app to be loaded, or refund my money.

The deadbolt is expensive, yet they have the audacity to charge extra money ($100) for the \"functioning\" version of the app and hardware (check / lock / unlock out of bluetooth range).  They also would like you to pay extra for VIRTUAL KEYS!!!  Really?  The Kevo does not link with the home automation hub, Wink, not sure if it works with Samsung or Apple's automation products, remote access requires their junk.  The lock doesn't work if you're already paired to a bluetooth device.  The app force closes on my Moto360 watch.    The physical quality of the lock is about a 3/10, I'm pretty sure you could defeat the lock with a decent screwdriver.  The lock is very loud, both mechanically as well as the beep tones if you leave them enabled.  This one is going back to the store, I'll stick with a good old regular z-wave lock, my Wink hub loves z-wave.  If someone is going to break in, I'd rather it be a hacker than a kid with a screwdriver.  Nest integration works ***great.

Better yet Android  Marshmallow? See the users of Android have been lied to for too long. We are always the ones that suffer while iOS is developed and updated right away. I preordered my first Kevo with the promise of an \"Android app coming soon\". Actually what happened is they took there time and waited 1.5 years to even release an android app. I patiently sat around and even ended up buying an iPad mini so that I did not have to use the key fob, that did not work half as well as it should have, just to get an app to update my lock and be able to open my door. So the next hurdle has been that suddenly I can't install this on the newest android phones. It has been like this going on a month. I tell you what UniKey..... You can keep your Kevo 2 and stick it where the sun doesn't shine. You claim to have heard peoples issues with your device, but it looks like to me the only thing you did was redesign the mechanics of the lock and added a few new features.....

I fear that if this type of issue exists that the software arm of your business (or your service partner) is completely incompetent and endangering the safety of me and my family.  I've sat by my door for 25 minutes now trying to connect and all the app wants to do is search for a lock, despite everything else working fine.  I will be following up with your support team.  Not a happy customer as of now."}

I have paid to have 2 of these locks installed in my home on the premise that I could (and used to be able to) use this with my smart phone. Wife's Samsung phone works just fine, but no dice on either Motorola. Kevo - please fix this - there is no excuse as to why this app should be incompatible with my device, especially running the latest version of Android."}

I have to agree with another poster below and that all of these people giving 1 stars due to Blu tooth issues is misleading. That's probably an issue with your phone rather than lock. I do NOT have to have app running in background to work,  I leave the phone in my front pocket,  and can effectively engage the lock within about 3 to 4 feet of the door. Works very well on my wife's iPhone 7 and iPhone se, however,  they DO need the app running in back ground to work (sucks to be apple)"}

The customer support is extremely slow, and not very helpful at times, but the warranty is handled well, I had to have mine replaced twice, didn't cost me a single penny...

One cool feature is the re-key, which lets u use ur current or existing door key assuming its the same brand as your kevo (mine is by kwikset).
