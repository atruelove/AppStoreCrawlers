# AppStoreCrawlers

Files and programs involved in analyzing the data extraced from these crawlers can be found in my other repository: https://github.com/atruelove/AppReviewAnalysis

This is repository for the app crawler program I've been working on as well as the data I've extraced using the program. To use the program, you need to install:

- Python
- Selenium
- Firefox
- Firefox WebDriver

I've also got copies of test programs and test data here, including test material from when I was using Scrapy instead of Selenium. These test materials will not be updated. For now, the files that are being worked on are:

- SeleniumCrawler.py
- Selenium App Reviews
